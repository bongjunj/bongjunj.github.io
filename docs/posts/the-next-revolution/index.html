		<h1>The Next Revolution</h1>
		<time datetime=" 2025-05-03T20:39:48">2025 May 3</time>
		<p>AI is going to change the world for good.
This is going to be the defining moment of human history similar to the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Information Revolution.</p>
<p>It was not long ago that AlphaFold struck me.
Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium_kor">Veritasium Korea</a>, I learned the detailed stories of AlphaFold.
Although I had seen how AlphaGo defeat 이세돌 (Lee, Sedol), the legendary Go player,
I was totally unaware how long AI had come since then.</p>
<p>AlphaFold discovered over 200 million proteins.
Human researchers, before AlphaFold, have discovered only 170,000 proteins.
The diffrence in scale is staggering.</p>
<p>This is an exciting moment because scale create paradigm shifts.
For analogy, consider how trains during the Industrial Revolution enabled people to travel further and faster.
People then could travel multiple cities and be in different time zones.
It demanded them to synchronize times across multiple cities.
Interestingly, the time synchronization problem raised the profound question: &ldquo;what is time?&rdquo;
The question eventually led to the discovery of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity.</p>
<p>In the same way as AlphaFold did to Biology, AI is going to generate scientific facts.
Imagine the world with AI that can bring us new scientific insights in an automated fashion.
We have never lived such era.</p>
<p>New mathematical theorems, new physical patterns and new machinery will be generated for us everyday.
The Agricultural Revolution introduced a new means of production: the cultivation of land through farming.
The Industrial Revolution also brought machanized mass production, replacing manual labor.
The Information Revolution enabled value creating through information processing, not from physical goods.
And now, the next revolution is going to introduce a new means of production: the automated generation of knowledge.</p>
